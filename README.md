# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Project Summary

This project implements the simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors into a UI where you can play against a computer. This is the first project where I implemented JavaScript. I learned how to manipulate the DOM and deepened my knowledge on how functions work with each other.

### Rules of the game are as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Rock beats Scissors.</li>
    <li>Paper beats Rock.</li>
    <li>Scissors beats Paper.</li>
    <li>If you pick the same choice as the computer, it is a draw</li>
    <li>First one to reach five points wins!</li>
</ul>
